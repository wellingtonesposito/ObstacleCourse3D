# ObstacleCourse3D
Unity and C# basic learning project 

The goal of this project is to move the yellow cube from the bottom left white pad to the upper right white pad, without hitting the obstacles on the way.
In case one of the obstacles is hit, the obstacle's color turns red, indicating that it was hit. To play, we must use the keys "left arrow" to move the cube to the left, "right arrow" to move the cube to the right, "up arrow" to move the cube up, and "down arrow" to move the cube down.

One level was developed to practice some basic functionalities from Unity and C# such as the features and methods listed below: 
><p>Start() & Update()</p>
><p>SerializeField</p>
><p>Input.GetAxis()</p>
><p>Time.deltaTime</p>
><p>Cinemachine Follow Camera</p>
><p>Basic Collision</p>
><p>OnCollisionEnter()</p>
><p>GetComponent<>()</p>
><p>Time.time</p>
><p>Tags</p>
><p>Prefabs</p>

This is a demonstration of a player successfully completing the level, hitting some obstacles on the way:
